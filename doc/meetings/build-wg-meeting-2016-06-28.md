## Minutes

Talked through/reviewed this issues:

 * OS X buildbots/ci: call to action #367
 * rsync endpoint to mirror the releases #55
 * Run and deploy nodejs-github-bot #404

Not many updates so we did not discuss them in depth.  On 404 will
see if we can find a time people are around as opposed to just
waiting until the next meeting.

Talked about installers
  * Myles working on electron based installer
  * Wanted feedback from this group
  * Joao mentioned that msi is really the right thing to use for Windows,
    but some wrapper installer to install the msi could make sense.

## Next meeting
