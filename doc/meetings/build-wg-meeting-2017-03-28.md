## Minutes

### Move nodejs/readable-stream CI from Travis to Jenkins [#657](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/657)
  * Discussion about moving to use Foundation infrastructure. We are not
    strictly firewalled, so likely not an issue.
  * Gibson will continue to work with them to implement and we’ll see if there
    are any issues.
### Add Kunal Pathak to Build WG [#649](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/649)
  * Everybody in the meeting agreed, we’ll add Kunal to the WG
### file and directory names for downloads [#515](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/515)
  * We agreed last meeting we should remove the agenda tag and discuss in
    github
### Draft text for HSTS communication [#484](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/484)
  * We agreed last meeting we should remove the agenda tag and discuss in
    github
### TAP Plugin issues on Jenkins [#453](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/453)
  * We agreed last meeting we should remove the agenda tag and discuss in
    GitHub

### Adding macOS workers.
  * Johan: We had an interesting opportunity which led into
    [this](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/539) and back to sleep. After
    we've sorted that we can revisit the opportunity and increase both
    redundancy and os versions tested.
  * Rod: We had been working with macOS hosting provider, but haven’t closed on
    this yet.
  * Rod to get email out and include Michael and Johan and we’ll try push
    forward.

### Bus factor:
  * Johan: I like Michaels idea of primary/backup for positions. Which would
    these positions be though? My ambition is that everybody in the build group
    would help out with the level of access they have – meaning all of our
    members should feel free to look at restarting/debugging individual
    workers. As for the higher tiers; we need to start by defining these
    positions.
  * Rod: good way to start is maintenance on the test workers.
  * Michael to open an issue to discuss the list of areas.

## Questions

### William Kapke - why not spend the community money?
  * Rod - we have done a good job getting contributions.  Once we start to pay
    then others may ask why they are not paid as well. Want to exhaust all
    possible channels before we go that way.
