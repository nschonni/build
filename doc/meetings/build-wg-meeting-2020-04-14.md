## Agenda

## Announcements

### nodejs/build

* retrospective on download outage [#2264](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2264)
  * Sam, should we be communicating with Azure, GitHub actions etc, to clarify expectations
    on uptime
  * Myles best thing we can do is to document what level of support (clarifying that there is 
    no SLA).  
  * Sam, we can encourage larger players (like GitHub) to update examples to avoid the 
    dependency, that could make a difference.

* Status page for NodeJS [2265](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2265)
* Automating Email Notifications when there is an "incident" [#2274](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2274)

    * Willing to look at Atlassian offering as it is SaS and we won’t have something additional to 
      maintain.
  * Let’s invite him to the next build WG meeting to bring us up to speed on the meeting
  * Myles has agreed to pitch in and will send request to foundation to get licence to try it out.
  * Ashley good to schedule a meeting in advance. 

* Platform requirements for Node.js 14 [#2168](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2168)
  * Using OSX to build (needed for notarization)
