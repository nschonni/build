## Minutes

* How can a project qualify for access to the build infrastructure? #448
  * at this point is pretty much limited to projects under the org, we
    don't have many which are asking and are not being considered for that
    so we can probably leave this on the back burner for now.
  * semi-related, node serialport might move to nodejs org,
    nvm has also made a request.

* OS X buildbots/ci: call to action #367
  * giving the sponsor option one more week otherwise will move forward
    to use foundation money.
  * We already have sign off to use foundation money to get this resolved.

* rsync endpoint to mirror the releases #55
  * no real discussion, just needs to be completed.

* Add docs required by TSC nodejs/github-bot#66
  * discussion was around whether it should be separate work
    group under the CTC or a part of the Build WG.
  * several Build WG members (Johan, Philip, and Hans)
    chimed in and augmented for the bot being a group under Build WG.
  * William Kapke (@williamkapke) argumented for the bot to be it.s
    own working group:
> The bot's scope is very crosscutting and will extend
  beyond the reach of even the CTC. This is why I pointed
  the Governance to the TSC.

  * the net is that the bot team is welcome to join build WG and do the
    work there but its up to the members of the bot group
    (@nodejs/github-bot) to propose/agree on what
    makes the most sense for that work.

* Process for determining supported platforms nodejs/node#8265
  * problem for node collaborator with random failures on newer platforms
  * how do we determine what platforms are officially supported
    * we have not found a good way to determine these
    * we would like to add new hardware before they are officially supported
  * can we treat experimental platforms as experimental?
    * make Jenkins treat any failures for platform X as flaky (yellow)
  * build group (Rod) will make proposal to TSC.

* TAP Plugin issues on Jenkins #453
  * we suspect that TAP Plugin is consuming much of the resources on Jenkins.
  * every time this runs it creates an XML file which is later
    read and parsed which consumes memory possible options:
    *  we could fix this (in Java)
    *  we could write our own converter
    *  we move to produce JUnit from our test suite
  * many other tasks depends / consumes TAP output
  * CITGM has had great success with JUnit output
    * great performance
    * easier to dig through / debug
  * Myles volunteers to take a stab at converter to generate junit from the
    existing tap files
  * Johan says this can be done on Jenkins master by writing
    to artifacts files which are sent back to Jenkins for processing
