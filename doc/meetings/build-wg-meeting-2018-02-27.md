## Agenda

### Clarify email aliases (e.g. build@iojs.org) [#1084](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1084)

* Rod: We do have different aliases, but there was a need for at least two levels of aliases
* Michael: Might be useful to have a readme in the email repo that documents this.
* Rod: Or a comments section in the aliases json file
* Gibson: I'll document that infra admins should add themselves

### Security: please pay careful attention to code running through CI [#1070](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1070)
* Gibson: I think this is on the agenda to discuss removing the Fedora machines

### New OSX infra walkthrough [#1026](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1026)
* Gibson: We should defer till George gets back
* Rod: What about the macOS 10.8 machine?
* Michael: I responded, we don't actually use that machine
* Rod: Would be good to get a release machine

### Use Foundation resources to support build [1154](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1154)
* Rod: I.m not sure this is a good idea.

### A novel approach to trimming Jenkins nodes by Node.js version [#1153](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1153)
* ran out of time, discuss through github
