## Minutes

### Option to run V8 test suite #199

Running tests should be fairly easy, hardest part is to figure out how to
configure all the prerequisites. Michael to follow up and report on progress.
First deliverable: a quick and dirty job in Jenkins to run this daily. We can
improve the process as we go.

### PPC platforms as part of standard release #205

### Jenkins downtime

Security vulnerability discovered in Jenkins. No evidence that our server was
compromised but we chose the safe route and assumed the worst, reprovisioned
everything.  ETA to be back online: Wednesday.
