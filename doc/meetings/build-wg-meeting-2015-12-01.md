* Johan Bergström
  * investigated Jenkins stability issues, tweaked JVM options, seems to be
    working better now
  * naming convention for hosts to better play with ansible roles for
    provisioning
  * moved some machines from Digital Ocean to SoftLayer

## Minutes

### Option to run V8 test suite #199

Running tests should be fairly easy, hardest part is to figure out how to
configure all the prerequisites. Michael to follow up and report on progress.
First deliverable: a quick and dirty job in Jenkins to run this daily. We can
improve the process as we go.

### PPC platforms as part of standard release #205

### Add FIPS mode build to CI #264

## Follow-ups

Take a look at open PRs in the build repo. Lots of stale stuff.

These issues were not fully discussed. Keep on the agenda for next meeting:

* [ ] Probably should discuss how to include node-gyp and NAN in Jenkins, we've had
  requests for both projects and it makes sense, particularly for NAN which has
  a big test suite (node-gyp has a ... smaller test suite).
* [ ] I've been pondering our ARM hardware and would like to discuss how we might go
  about ensuring that we have hardware test coverage that is as close as
  possible to what is being used in the wild for Node—for IoT, hobbyist, etc.
  users. Consider how newer platforms like Pi Zero have the potential to change
  the landscape. Also think of MIPS and how we have zero coverage there. It
  might be something we can defer to the Hardware WG, maybe they can do some
  surveys or perhaps they have existing data.
